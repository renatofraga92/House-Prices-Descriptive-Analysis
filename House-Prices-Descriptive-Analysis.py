# Observations and analyses
# - The distribution is skewed (Skewness = 0.83), indicating a long tail to the right due to the value 300,000.
# - The standard deviation (45,227.82) relative to the mean (203,000.00) represents 22.3% variability,
#   indicating high variability in prices, with values ranging from 150,000 to 300,000.
# - The mean (203,000) being greater than the median (190,000) reinforces the positive skewness.
# - The histogram shows a peak between 150,000-200,000 and a stretched tail toward 250,000-300,000.
