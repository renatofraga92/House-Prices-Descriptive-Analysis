## Statistical Parameters

### Variability (STD/Mean Ratio)
- **Low Variability**: < 10% (e.g., STD = 100, Mean = 2000 → 5%)
- **Moderate Variability**: 10% to 30% (e.g., STD = 356.60, Mean = 1616.67 → 22%, as in this project, indicating moderate variability)
- **High Variability**: > 30% (e.g., STD = 1000, Mean = 2000 → 50%)

### Skewness
- **Symmetric**: ≈ 0 (e.g., -0.5 to 0.5)
- **Negative Skewness (Left-Tailed)**: < 0 (e.g., -1 or less, indicating a long tail to the left)
- **Positive Skewness (Right-Tailed)**: > 0 (e.g., 0.36, as in this project, indicating a long tail to the right due to the June peak)

### Kurtosis
- **Thin Tails (Platykurtic)**: < 0 (e.g., -0.98, as in this project, indicating thinner tails and fewer extreme outliers than a normal distribution)
- **Normal (Mesokurtic)**: ≈ 0 (e.g., -0.5 to 0.5)
- **Thick Tails (Leptokurtic)**: > 0 (e.g., 1 or more, indicating thicker tails and more extreme outliers)

### Range (Amplitude)
- **Low Amplitude**: < 20% of the Mean (e.g., Range = 400, Mean = 2000 → 20%)
- **Moderate Amplitude**: 20% to 50% of the Mean (e.g., Range = 500, Mean = 2000 → 25%)
- **High Amplitude**: > 50% of the Mean (e.g., Range = 1000, Mean = 1616.67 → 62%, as in this project, indicating high variability)

### 90-10 Percentile Spread
- **Low Spread**: < 20% of the Mean (e.g., P90 = 2200, P10 = 1800 → Diff = 400, Mean = 2000 → 20%)
- **Moderate Spread**: 20% to 50% of the Mean (e.g., P90 = 2200, P10 = 1600 → Diff = 600, Mean = 2000 → 30%)
- **High Spread**: > 50% of the Mean (e.g., P90 = 2050, P10 = 1300 → Diff = 750, Mean = 1616.67 → 46%, as in this project, indicating high variability)

### Coefficient of Variation (CV)
- **Low CV**: < 0.1 (10%) (e.g., STD = 100, Mean = 2000 → 5%)
- **Moderate CV**: 0.1 to 0.3 (10% to 30%) (e.g., STD = 356.60, Mean = 1616.67 → 22%, as in this project, indicating moderate variability)
- **High CV**: > 0.3 (30%) (e.g., STD = 1000, Mean = 2000 → 50%)
